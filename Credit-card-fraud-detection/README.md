# Credit Card Fraud Detection and Transaction Verification

## Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to verify transactions. The project uses a RandomForestClassifier model trained on a dataset of credit card transactions and incorporates data cleaning, normalization, and visualization techniques.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Normalization of transaction amounts
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Training a RandomForestClassifier model
- Visualizing correlations with a heatmap
- Implementing a GUI using Tkinter for transaction verification

## Setup

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
